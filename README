Description of features implemented:

	-  All features requested are fully implemented with the exception of XSL stylesheets (enter random in this field 
	creating a new channel)
	- The warandpeace.xp file may be found in /resources. The paths are newline-separated. 
	- XPathCrawler accepts an optional #file download limit. This seems unnecessary in the sandbox.
	- XPathCrawler also accepts an optional logger flag. Simply append -l to the end of the call. 
	- The Logger utility outputs to LOG (NOTE: lines flush on every 15 accumulated)
	- Error output is not optional and updates live (flush on every line) - this can be found in ERROR

Extra credits claimed:

Special instructions for building or running:
- The following should start the crawler with no file limit and the Logger utility disabled.
java -cp target/WEB-INF/lib/je-4.1.7.jar:target/WEB-INF/lib/jtidy-r938.jar:target/WEB-INF/lib/hw2.jar XPathCrawler http://crawltest.cis.upenn.edu /bdbstore 2
- Please Note: XPathServlet also requires the jtidy and je jar files (same location).
- This is compatible with my server implementation. The same may not apply to Tomcat/Jetty.
